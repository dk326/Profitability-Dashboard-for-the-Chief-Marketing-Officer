# Profitability-Dashboard-for-the-Chief-Marketing-Officer

**About The Project**

This project was done as an assessment for the unit descriptive analytics. A dashboard is developed for a restaurant chain called burrito king. The target audience is the chief marketing officer. The purpose of the dashboard is to monitor profitability of products through different regions in Australia. The data was provided by my university.

The interactive dashboard was developed with Tableau and is presented with a wordpress website. 

The live dashboard can be accessed [here](https://wp.deakin.edu.au/staticSites/DeakinUniversity-3962101_1317165_s220478042/deakinsso_DeakinUniversity-3962101_1317165_s220478042_20231011_145940/live-dashboard/).

The following is a breif description of the dashboard and its funcionality. 

**Overview**

- The locations (stores) of the chain are visualized on the map with the use of green bubbles.
- More profitable the location, the larger and darker the shade of the bubble.
- The dashboard layout follows a 'z' letter format where the most important elements will be caught by the eyes first.

**Use case of the Marketing Officer**

- Assume that you are the marketing manager of Burrito King and you want to get an overview of the profitability of your products.

**Filtered for west region**

- Lets assume you want to see how the western region is performing. You can simply select the west region tile on the tree map.
- You can see that all products except beans are doing well in this region,
- You can also see that some stores are doing well as they are large and dark green on the map.
- Few stores are not doing so well.

**Filtered by Product (Beans)**

- Lets say you want to look more into the product type ‘beans’, which is showing losses in the western region.
- Clicking on the relevant bar for beans will filter everything for beans for the western region.
- You can immediately see that all stores are doing well on 'beans' except for one, which is Nevada.
- This is shown by both the bubble in the map which is very small and pale green, and also by looking at the table view on the right hand side.

**Filtered by location**
- You can take a more detailed look at Nevada by selecting that bubble.
- By selecting that store the you can see that even though profits are on a downwards trend, sales have been increasing.
- You can further explore the table which contains other factors which affect profitability such as cost of goods sold and total expenses to see if they are an issue.

<img width="400" alt="3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ccbd9f7-3c0f-49bf-94b4-7c010f4ea4f7">

- The regions are visualized with using a tree map.
- Similar to the bubbles on the map, the tree map follows a pastel green where the regions will become larger and darker in shade as profits grow.
- further, since this is an interactive dashboard, the regions can be used as a filter.

**Products**

**Marketing vs Sales**

- This visualization is designed to provide the marketing manager with insights into marketing expenditures and the corresponding returns generated through sales.


**Details on costs**

- To visualize the performance of each state a table was selected as it is a convenient way to deliver more details to the user.
- Upon initial inspection the user will only see the top 3 states with the highest profits and sales.
- However, using the horizontal scroll bar users can see marketing costs, cost of goods and total expenditure for that stage. Using the vertical scroll bar, users can see all the states.
